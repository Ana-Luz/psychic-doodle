# web-app

A Web App with an HTML page, a CSS file and a JavaScript file. All this with the theme of the new upcoming Barbie movie, which arrives in Brazilian theaters next week on July 20, and is one of the most anticipated films of 2023.

## The Challenge

A Web App that consists of:
- An HTML page with the following semantic structure inside the body: header, main, footer;
- A CSS file that changes the header and footer background color using a CLASS; changes the color of main using an ID;
- A javascript file that logs into the "hello world" console.

Where:
- To open in the browser, just run the HTML file directly;
- The HTML page loads in the CSS;
- The HTML page loads in Javascript.
